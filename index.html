<h2>kitten info</h2>
<br>
<p>
    A kitten, also known as a kitty or kitty cat,
     is a juvenile cat. After being born, kittens are totally dependent on their mother for survival and they do not normally
     open their eyes until after seven to ten days. After about two weeks, kittens quickly 
     develop and begin to explore the world outside the nest.
</p>
<h2>origins of word</h2>
<p>
The word "kitten" derives from the Middle English word kitoun, 
which in turn came from the Old French chitoun or cheton. Juvenile big cats are called "cubs" rather than kittens; either term may be used for the young of 
smaller wild felids, such as ocelots, caracals and lynx, but "kitten" is usually more common for these species.

    <h2>first weeks for kitten</h2>
    <p>During the first few weeks of life, a kitten’s primary concerns are feeding, keeping warm, 
        developing social skills and learning how to excrete on his own. In most cases, humans will simply 
        watch the mother cat perform her duties. However, if the kitten in your care has been separated from his mother 
        or if the mother cat has rejected her young or cannot produce enough milk, caring for him is up to you.
    </p>
<br>
<h2>How Do I Feed a Newborn Kitten?</h2>
<p>A mother cat’s milk provides everything a kitten needs during th
e first four weeks of life. If you have newborn kittens who’ve been separated from 
their mother, consult with a veterinarian, shelter or experienced foster care giver who can help you find a new mother 
cat with a small litter-she may be able to nurse the orphaned babies. If you cannot find a foster mother, please consult with your
 veterinarian about the proper way to bottle-feed with a commercial milk replacer. Please do not offer regular cow’s milk to cats of any age. It 
 is not easily digestible and can cause diarrhea.
</p>
<br>
<h2>What Do Kittens Eat Besides Milk?</h2>
<p>When the orphaned kittens are three to four weeks old, begin to offer milk replacer in a shallow bowl, 
    then introduce a moist, easily chewable diet. You can make gruel from warmed milk replacer and a high-quality dry 
    or canned kitten food. Serve it in a shallow bowl and feed the kittens several times each day. By five weeks old, 
    they should be getting used to their new diet. By six to seven weeks old, they should be able to chew dry food and you’ll 
    no longer need to moisten it. Kittens are typically fully weaned by around eight weeks of age.</p>
